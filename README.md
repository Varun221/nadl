[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/heytanay/nadl.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/heytanay/nadl)

A small Automatic Differentiation Library written in python that can be used to perform graphed automatic diff in reverse mode.

If what I wrote above didn't make any sense to you, then just understand that this is a little deep learning library. Focus on the word "little".
